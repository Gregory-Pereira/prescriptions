          Found RHSA-2021:1611 in the base image used: The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: uncontrolled allocation on the stack in function unit_name_path_escape leads to crash (CVE-2021-33910) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: memory leak in button_open() in login/logind-button.c when udev events are received (CVE-2019-20386) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          Git is a distributed revision control system with a decentralized architecture. As opposed to centralized version control systems with a client-server model, Git ensures that each working copy of a Git repository is an exact copy with complete revision history. This not only allows the user to work on and contribute to projects without the need to have permission to push the changes to their official repositories, but also makes it possible for the user to work with no network connection. The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: git (2.18.4). (BZ#1826008) Security Fix(es): * git: Crafted URL containing new lines, empty host or lacks a scheme can cause credential leak (CVE-2020-11008) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: memory leak in button_open() in login/logind-button.c when udev events are received (CVE-2019-20386) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
